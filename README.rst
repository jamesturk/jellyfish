    :alt: Documentation Status

Jellyfish is a python library for doing approximate and phonetic matching of strings.

Written by James Turk <dev@jamesturk.net> and Michael Stephens.

See https://github.com/jamesturk/jellyfish/graphs/contributors for contributors.

See http://jellyfish.readthedocs.io for documentation.

**Jellyfish >= 0.7 only supports Python 3, if you need Python 2 please use 0.6.x.**

Included Algorithms
===================

String comparison:

* Levenshtein Distance
* Damerau-Levenshtein Distance
* Jaro Distance
* Jaro-Winkler Distance
* Match Rating Approach Comparison
* Hamming Distance

Phonetic encoding:

* American Soundex
* Metaphone
* NYSIIS (New York State Identification and Intelligence System)
* Match Rating Codex

Example Usage
=============

>>> import jellyfish
>>> jellyfish.levenshtein_distance(u'jellyfish', u'smellyfish')
2
>>> jellyfish.jaro_distance(u'jellyfish', u'smellyfish')
0.89629629629629637
>>> jellyfish.damerau_levenshtein_distance(u'jellyfish', u'jellyfihs')
1

>>> jellyfish.metaphone(u'Jellyfish')
'JLFX'
>>> jellyfish.soundex(u'Jellyfish')
'J412'
>>> jellyfish.nysiis(u'Jellyfish')
'JALYF'
>>> jellyfish.match_rating_codex(u'Jellyfish')
'JLLFSH'

Running Tests
=============

If you are interested in contributing to Jellyfish, you may want to
run tests locally. Jellyfish uses tox_ to run tests, which you can
setup and run as follows::

  pip install tox
  # cd jellyfish/
  tox
